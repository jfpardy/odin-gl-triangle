# Odin/Opengl/Glfw Triangle example
A very basic triangle example in Odin using OpenGL.

Code is essentially ported from the [LearnOpenGL site](https://learnopengl.com).

Odin language can be installed using the instructions at [the official website](https://odin-lang.org)

Code only depends on packages already in the odin core/vendor libraries and can be built
with the command: `odin build main`
